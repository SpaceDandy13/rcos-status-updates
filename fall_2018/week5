5th week:
1.Leaning Aframe.
2.I tried to change some codes. 
  Now the showpath.html can take the origin and destination in and find out how many data(pictures) are between these two places.
  It can also move forward. But the biggest problem is still unfixed. Although we can see the name of the building, 
  there is not 360 picture behind it. ShowPath.js reads the data successfully. Maybe there is still something about url.

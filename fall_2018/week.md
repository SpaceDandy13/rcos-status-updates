1st week:
1.I took some photos inside and outside of some buildings.
2.Old photos can not be shown in the website.
3.I am learning html and trying to fix this bug.

2nd week:
1.I took some photos inside and outside of some buildings.
2.I have learned the basic of html and I am learning javascript now.
3.I find that they used a framework called Aframe to build the project so I learning about how Aframe works.

3rd week:
1.Still learning javascript.
2.I think I find the reason why VR view can not work on the website. By looking at the code, I find that pictures are stored in aws. So I think maybe there is something wrong with the account.

4th week:
1.Leaning Aframe.
2.The database(photos) is not the reason why VR view does not work. We changed the url and use a school cardboard instead of aws. It become harder to debug because previous members wrote many codes.

5th week:
1.Leaning Aframe.
2.I tried to change some codes. Now the showpath.html can take the origin and destination in and find out how many data(pictures) are between these two places. It can also move forward. But the biggest problem is still unfixed. Although we can see the name of the building, there is not 360 picture behind it. ShowPath.js reads the data successfully. Maybe there is still something about url.

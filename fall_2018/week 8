1.I learned more about A-frame.
2.I was trying to find out the reason why website can not change the background. 
  The code wrote by previous member looks the same as the tutorial. I am a little confused since changing 
  A-frame background is not a complicated part.
3.I also find another problem. After trying about 20~30 times, I can't open the VR view due to OVER_QUERY_LIMIT.
  It's a problem about google services because of too many query. I have no idea how to solve it right now and it 
  seems like I have to wait for 24hour before I can try again.
4.Because there are not enough pictures between buildings, VR view between some places is not aviliable. My friend and I
  was taking photos and I will put them in the program later.

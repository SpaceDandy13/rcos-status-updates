## Last Week's Accomplishments
I wrote most of the index APP/home

## This Week's Plan
We need some photos of each dinning house and foods. 
The idea is that we will ask user to upload pictures, ratings and comments in the future. But for now, since we have not finish the interact interface, we need to take some photos by ourselves.
I am asigned to take photos of barh and foods in barh.

## Last Week's Accomplishments
By communicating with the dinning hall and comparing the data with the foods, we found that data from school website is really inaccurate. So we decided to build our own database. We are still thinking about how to get the accurate data. Some of us(including me) thought we could ask user to upload the picture and name of the manu.  But others stated that users are not willing to do some many jobs and sometimes they may upload wrong image for fun. Currently our database is depend on school website's data. Maybe we will change the database next semester.
I wrote some comments and specifications of the program.
Since I lack of experience of web programming, my teamleader asked me to fully understand the structure and write some index of the program.

## This Week's Plan
Fully understand the structure and write some index of the program.

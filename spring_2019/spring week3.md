## Last Week's Accomplishments
Did bad in the exam.
We discussed the structure. We decided to use MVC  design pattern to implement this project. 
Because I am not familiar with the web programming, they asked me to do some jobs that do not need to write code. 

## This Week's Plan
I am learning about web programing.
I will communicate with the dinning hall to see if we can get a more accurate data from school website.

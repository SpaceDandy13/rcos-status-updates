## Last Week's Accomplishments
I think we did well in presentation. 
It is the finish stage of this semester and I was assigned to do some testing.
I found some bugs in the website. Picture and the discription are not corresponding. I told the member who built the database and he said he would fix it. I also find a bug that some data appear more than one time and together we find that we use a wrong method when we link the database to our php.

## This Week's Plan
It's the last week of the semester and I hope I can do well in the final.
